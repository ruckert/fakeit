# fakeit, until you make it
A strange use of Snap.svg.js to make interface prototypes with svg mockups

I did it, and I keep doing this, because I want to continue creating my interface mockups with vector graphic softwares (like Illustrator and Inkscape) and easily transform the work result into testable prototypes.

Project structure
- dependencies -> a folder to store the snap.svg.js =P
- mockups -> a place to put your svg files
- styles -> a place to put your stylesheets; there's a reset css file too
- prototype.html -> here is where you reference the mockup .svg files
- fakeit.js -> here's the place where the magic happens
- settings.js -> put your definitions here
